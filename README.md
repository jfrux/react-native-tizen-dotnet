# react-native-tizen-dotnet
React Native is an open source framework for building native apps with React.JS. It is supported in Android, iOS and Windows currently.

**react-native-tizen-dotnet** is a React Native framework for developer to build Tizen.NET apps on Tizen.  
It provides the same fundamental UI components and user experience with Tizen native Apps. Also it provides a easy and fast debugging way with Hot Module Reloading feature.

Currently, react-native-tizen-dotnet based on [react-native 0.42](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/0.42-stable) and [react-native-windows 0.42](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-windows/tree/0.42-stable).

## Getting Started
### Installing dependencies
-  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
-  [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
### Steps(Ubuntu env. as example)
-   $ ```sudo npm i -g create-react-native-tizen-app```
-   $ ```create-react-native-tizen-app myTizenApp```
-   $ ```cd myTizenApp```
-   $ ```vim package.json``` //change "tvip": "192.168.100.1" to your Tv IP
-   $ ```yarn bundle``` // for release mode (npm run bundle)
-   $ ```yarn bundle --dev``` // for dev mode, js file not ugly (npm run bundle --dev)
-   $ ```yarn package``` // packaging tpk for Tizen (npm run package)
-   $ ```yarn launch``` // launch tpk to Tizen TV , Before launch you [Enable Developer Mode on the TV](#Connect-to-TV) to TV) first (npm run launch)

## Connect to TV
Refer to this website, **Enable Developer Mode on the TV**:  
https://developer.samsung.com/SmartTV/develop/getting-started/using-sdk/tv-device.html

## Running in emulator
react-native-tizen-dotnet depend on C++ libraries JSCore and yoga. And emulator has diffrent CPU Arch with TV device. So we provide diffrent C++ libraries(arm & i586).  
When create react-native-tizen-dotnet project, the arm based libraries provided defaultly in `your-project\Tizen\lib\`.  
If you want running your app in emulator, you can just replace them with i586 libraries. i586 libraries here:  
```
Framework/ReactNet/JSCore/libJSCore_i586.so
Framework/ReactNet/yoga/libyoga_i586.so
```

## Debug
`react-native-tizen-dotnet` support same debugging way with `react-naitve`. (likes
`Hot Reloading`, `JS Remote Debugging` and others debugging way of ReactNative)

To enable debugging, you need follow these steps:
1. Modify `package.json` in your app to config debug mode.
   * Set `mode` of `config` as *Debug*(Default setting is *Release*)
2. Launch debug server in your PC
   ``` shell
   # Server will running with 8081 port
   npm run server
   ```
3. Package your app and launch on TV(App will try to connect debug server automatically)
4. Press `Red`/`A` key on remote controller to set debug items
   * If your app can't connect to debug server, you can set host IP here
     > If `input panel` is hard to use, suggest using real keybroad
